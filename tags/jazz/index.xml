I have created a string backing for the melody, then added the melody from “Memories of Tomorrow” (another piece studied in class) as a counterpoint, and also my own melody as a further counterpoint. Finally, I created a new ending, based on a descending harmonic progression.</description></item><item><title>500 Miles High</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/500-miles-high/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 05:49:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/500-miles-high/</guid><description>I took the lead sheet and expanded it to four parts for string quartet, with each instrument (apart from cello) taking turns to play the melody, with the other instruments either providing counterpoint or harmony.</description></item><item><title>Memories of Tomorrow</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/memories-of-tomorrow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2014 05:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/memories-of-tomorrow/</guid><description>I took the original lead sheet provided in the assignment, then expanded to four parts that are polyrhythmic as well as polyphonic (based on Latin rhythms). I also added separate improvisations for piano and flute. Finally, I added open-voiced string harmonisation in the final section to indicate the guide tones and basis for future improvisation.</description></item></channel></rss>
