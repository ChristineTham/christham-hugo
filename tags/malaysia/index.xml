The noodles are usually thin egg noodles and the sauce tends to be thick, dark, slightly sweet. As a child, my mum sometimes buy them from a hawker stall when she goes to the market in the early morning, so by the time we kids get up, we are treated a beautiful kon loh mee as a breakfast!</description></item></channel></rss>
