I have decided to play it at a slower tempo than usual, to highlight each note and to introduce micro rhythms within the bar and across bars. The piano is a virtual Bosendorfer 290 recorded at EastWest Studios, and the piece was played on a Kawai MP10 and then processed using Logic Pro X, QL Spaces and iZotope Ozone 8.</description></item><item><title>Bach - Adagio from Concerto for solo keyboard No. 3 in D minor</title><link>https://christham.net/christham-hugo/blog/bach-adagio-from-concerto-for-solo-keyboard-no.-3-in-d-minor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2018 07:16:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christham.net/christham-hugo/blog/bach-adagio-from-concerto-for-solo-keyboard-no.-3-in-d-minor/</guid><description>This is the second movement from J S Bach&amp;rsquo;s arrangement of Alessandro Marcello&amp;rsquo;s Oboe Concerto BWV 974 (BC L194). It is not often performed, but after hearing Glenn Gould&amp;rsquo;s amazing rendition of it, I had to learn how to play it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t rely on the metronome as i wanted the freedom of varying the tempo, but I visually aligned to the target tempo at the start so the first 10 bars or so are pretty on the beat, after that &amp;hellip; Recorded using a Kawai MP10.</description></item><item><title>Brandenburg Concerto No.5 in D major, BWV 1050 – I.
