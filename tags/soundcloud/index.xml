I have decided to play it at a slower tempo than usual, to highlight each note and to introduce micro rhythms within the bar and across bars. The piano is a virtual Bosendorfer 290 recorded at EastWest Studios, and the piece was played on a Kawai MP10 and then processed using Logic Pro X, QL Spaces and iZotope Ozone 8.</description></item><item><title>Bach - Adagio from Concerto for solo keyboard No. 3 in D minor</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/bach-adagio-from-concerto-for-solo-keyboard-no.-3-in-d-minor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2018 07:16:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/bach-adagio-from-concerto-for-solo-keyboard-no.-3-in-d-minor/</guid><description>This is the second movement from J S Bach&amp;rsquo;s arrangement of Alessandro Marcello&amp;rsquo;s Oboe Concerto BWV 974 (BC L194). It is not often performed, but after hearing Glenn Gould&amp;rsquo;s amazing rendition of it, I had to learn how to play it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t rely on the metronome as i wanted the freedom of varying the tempo, but I visually aligned to the target tempo at the start so the first 10 bars or so are pretty on the beat, after that &amp;hellip; Recorded using a Kawai MP10.</description></item><item><title>Winter Music (electronic 115bpm)</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/winter-music-electronic-115bpm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 06:14:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/winter-music-electronic-115bpm/</guid><description>My first project in Maschine 3 – a dance arrangement of Roger Eno’s track from Between Tides album, with the speed doubled to 115bpm and the Focus kit from Prismatic Bliss.</description></item><item><title>Adagio (2nd movement) from Oboe Concerto in D minor (Alessandro Marcello)</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/adagio-2nd-movement-from-oboe-concerto-in-d-minor-alessandro-marcello/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 06:14:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/adagio-2nd-movement-from-oboe-concerto-in-d-minor-alessandro-marcello/</guid><description>My first arrangement for 2018! This is a synth arrangement of the slow movement from Alessandro Marcello&amp;rsquo;s beautiful Oboe Concerto in D minor, op. 1 using Logic Pro native instruments. It is a beautiful and tranquil piece that is perhaps not well known (even though JS Bach transcribed it for harpsichord).</description></item><item><title>A Twin Peaks dream</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/a-twin-peaks-dream/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2017 06:12:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/a-twin-peaks-dream/</guid><description>Inspired by watching Twin Peaks The Return, here is a short electronic track, done in Logic Pro X and Native Instruments Komplete 11.

I have created a string backing for the melody, then added the melody from “Memories of Tomorrow” (another piece studied in class) as a counterpoint, and also my own melody as a further counterpoint. Finally, I created a new ending, based on a descending harmonic progression.</description></item><item><title>Ave Maria (Vavilov)</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/ave-maria-vavilov/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2014 06:06:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/blog/ave-maria-vavilov/</guid><description>Incorrectly ascribed to Guilio Caccini, this work was actually composed by Vladimir Fyodorovich Vavilov (Влади́мир Фёдорович Вави́лов) in 1970 and featured in his album “Lute music of the XVI-XVII cent.” (Лютневая музыка 16-17 веков) released on the Melodiya label.
