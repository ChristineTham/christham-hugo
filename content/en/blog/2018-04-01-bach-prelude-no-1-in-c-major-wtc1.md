First piano recording done using a metronome - Bach's Prelude No 1. I have decided to play it at a slower tempo than usual, to highlight each note and to introduce micro rhythms within the bar and across bars. The piano is a virtual Bosendorfer 290 recorded at EastWest Studios, and the piece was played on a Kawai MP10 and then processed using Logic Pro X, QL Spaces and iZotope Ozone 8.
