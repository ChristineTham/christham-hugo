My first arrangement for 2018! This is a synth arrangement of the slow movement from Alessandro Marcello's beautiful Oboe Concerto in D minor, op. 1 using Logic Pro native instruments. It is a beautiful and tranquil piece that is perhaps not well known (even though JS Bach transcribed it for harpsichord).
