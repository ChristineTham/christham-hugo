Incorrectly ascribed to Guilio Caccini, this work was actually composed by Vladimir Fyodorovich Vavilov (Влади́мир Фёдорович Вави́лов) in 1970 and featured in his album &#8220;Lute music of the XVI-XVII cent.&#8221; (Лютневая музыка 16-17 веков) released on the Melodiya label.

I listened to the original recording, transcribed it to Notion, then rearranged it for woodwinds, strings and harp, voiced using the EWQL Symphonic Orchestra.
