Mayfield was established in 1984 by the Hawkins family, initially as a sheep farm. The heart of our property has been gradually transformed – with the help of talented local landscapers and tradespeople – from bare paddocks into one of the largest, privately owned cool climate gardens in the world.

Mayfield has been inspired by the magnificent gardens of Europe. Owned by the Hawkins family, Mayfield Garden (open 363 days of the year) and The Hawkins’ Family Garden, together, cover more than 64 hectares (160 acres).

While the garden represents one family’s dream, the long-term vision is that it will be enjoyed by people from near and far for generations to come.
