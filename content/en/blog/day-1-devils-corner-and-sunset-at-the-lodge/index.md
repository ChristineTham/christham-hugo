We flew from Sydney to Hobart on Qantas QF1583 and this is the first time we have flown domestic in a few years. I liked using the automatic bag check in system that automatically recognises the bag based on the Qantas smart luggage tag was great (even though I had some difficulty using it). There was no on-board entertainment system, so I watched a movie on the iPad (Walter Mitty &#8211; one of my favourite films).

On landing, the airport has not changed much since the last time. We had to disembark down a flight of stairs and walked into the airport to collect our baggage. After that we picked up the Avis rental car (it&#8217;s an electric blue Toyota Corolla &#8211; cool!) and started driving towards Freycinet National Park.

We took the Tasman Highway to Sorell, stopped by at Coles to stock up on groceries and water, then headed on the A3 coastal route. Along the way, we stopped at a cellar door called [Devil&#8217;s Corner][1]. This has a lookout from which we can view the Moulting Lagoon wetlands, The Hazards and Freycinet Peninsula. The facility is owned and constructed by Brown Brothers and if I had known that I would have bought some wine.
