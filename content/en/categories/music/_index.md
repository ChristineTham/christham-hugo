My interests in music are broad, ranging from classical, jazz, contemporary to modern. My favourite composer of all time is probably Johann Sebastian Bach, but I also like many of the other classical composers. I listen to mostly Puccini and Wagner operas. In terms of jazz, I love Pat Metheny and Keith Jarrett. I also love electronic music, particularly Vangelis, Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre. My favourite minimalist composers are Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Adams. I listen to range of modern artists including Mike Oldfield, Pet Shop Boys, Madonna, Phil Collins.

I also like playing the piano and guitar, and composing music, which I do in my own studio complete with mixing and monitoring consoles, digital audio workstation, and various instruments including a stage piano.

I am also obsessed with synthesizers ever since I heard the music of Vangelis on the Cosmos TV series. I currently own a Kawai stage piano, several MIDI controllers (NI Komplete Kontrol A25 and S88MkII) and Maschine 3. I also own various virtual instruments (NI Komplete Ultimate, EastWest, SonicCouture, Sonokinetic, Korg, Roland, UVI). My favourite notation software are Notion and Finale, and I use Logic Pro X as my DAW.
