# Chris Tham Personal Site

This is a version of my personal blog/web site written in Markdown and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The site design was originally a fork of [Doks](https://getdoks.org), but I have added various features. It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

To run a local version of the website, clone the repository and execute:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
