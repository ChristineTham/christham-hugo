I soon graduated to road bikes, and currently own a number of road bikes.</description></item><item><title>Art</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/categories/art/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 06:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/categories/art/</guid><description>In addition, I sometimes dabble with drawings with pencil, COPIC markers, watercolours and even fountain pens.

My favourite composer of all time is probably Johann Sebastian Bach, but I also like many of the other classical composers. I listen to mostly Puccini and Wagner operas. In terms of jazz, I love Pat Metheny and Keith Jarrett. I also love electronic music, particularly Vangelis, Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre. My favourite minimalist composers are Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Adams.</description></item><item><title>Art</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/categories/website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/categories/website/</guid><description>In addition, I sometimes dabble with drawings with pencil, COPIC markers, watercolours and even fountain pens.

I generally like design to be simple, functional, classic, but not necessarily tradition.
I also like designing things. My favourite colour is pink, and I try and incorporate that in all my designs. All my websites are designed by me.</description></item><item><title>Photography</title><link>https://christinetham.github.io/categories/photography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christinetham.github.io/categories/photography/</guid><description>I started taking photos in high school using my father&amp;rsquo;s Yashica rangefinder. I had a series of Pentax SLR bodies and a variety of lenses. With digital photography, I bought a Kodak DC220 in 1999 and currently uses a variety of brands including Sony (α9, α7r, α6500, NEX-F3, NEX-5N, RX100MkIV, HS50V), Leica (M10), Panasonic (GX9), Nikon 1 (J5, V3, V2, J1) and Pentax (K-01).</description></item></channel></rss>
