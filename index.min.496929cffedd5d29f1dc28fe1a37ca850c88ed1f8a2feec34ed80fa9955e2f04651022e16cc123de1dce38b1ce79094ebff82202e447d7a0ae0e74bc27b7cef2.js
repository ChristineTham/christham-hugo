Epitaph # The following is taken from an epitaph erected by The N.S. Tham Clansmen Association:
Kapitan Tham Yong, also known as Tham Tuck Thong and Tham Onn Yong, was a Chinese leader in Negeri Sembilan during the late 19th Century.
He was born in China during the end of the Ching Dynasty, he left his homeland in Dragon Mouth Village of Changsha Township by Kaiping District in the Province of GuangDong, and sailed to Malaya in search of a new life.
As a humble and kind hearted man, he believed in honesty and the virtues of frugality. He worked his way to become a prominent tin miner in Seremban and was highly regarded by the British Colonial Government as well as the local community. As a result of this achievement, he was conferred a Chinese Kapitan. He died on on 8th August 1913 at the age of 57.
Kapitan Tham Yong made significant contributions to the revolutionary affairs of Dr. Sun Yat Sen, in addition to the Chinese community in Negeri Sembilan. In his endeavors, he donated a piece of land at Jalan Temiang in Seremban to build the Chinese Maternity Hospital for the poor and needy. (The hospital was later converted to Wah Chai Association which handiest matters in relation to Chinese burial grounds.) He also donated one acre of land at Bukit Rase, Seremban to house a Chinese cemetery (now the main graveyard of the Tham Clan of HongYang); managed by the Tham Clan Association.
After the independence of Malaya, the local Government changed the name of Murray Street in Seremban to Jalan Kapitan Tham Yong in honour of his numerous contributions to the country.
With the consent of his descendants, The Tham Clansmen Association of Malaysia and The N.S. Tham Clansmen Association had decided to move the late Kapitan Tham Yong and his wife’s grave to the main burial ground of HongYang Tham Clan, thereby marking the area as a piece of homage for the future generation.
Erected by The N.S. Tham Clansmen Association The Tham Clansmen Association of Malaysia On 2nd May 1999
Jalan Kapitan Tam Yeong # Today, there is a street named after my great grandfather. Jalan Kapitan Tam Yeong is a road on the northern part of downtown Seremban (formerly part of Murray St). It connects Jalan Tun Dr Ismail to Jalan Leftenan Adnan. In between, it also forms junctions with Jalan Dato Bandar Tunggal, Jalan Seng Meng Lee and Jalan Yam Tuan.

It is open to the public daily except Mondays, from 11 am to 5 pm.
`}),e.add({id:4,href:"/about/background/tham-surname/",title:"The Tham (譚) surname",description:"The History of the Tham (譚) surname (Tan in Hanyu Pinyin)",content:`
The surname Tham (譚) is pronounced and romanised differently in different languages and dialects:
Tan (Hokkien Chinese and Mandarin Chinese) Tan (Japanese) Dam (Korean) Đàm (Vietnamese) Tam (Cantonese Chinese and Hakka Chinese) Tham (Hokkien Chinese and Teochew Chinese) Ham, Hom, Hum, Tom, Thom (Toisanese Chinese) The standard Hanyu Pinyin romanisation is Tan and it is pronounced Taam4 (Jyutping romanisation) in Cantonese.
According to Wikipedia, it is the 56th most common Chinese surname.
Early History # The earliest known Tan is King Tan (Tan Gong 谭公) who appeared in the Book of Odes Shih-ching. He ruled over the State of Sung (Sung kuo 宋國), married Zhuang Jiang (庄姜) and was appointed a Viscount in the Zhou (周) Dynasty. The surname Tan became a hereditary surname to be passed down to descendants. He also became known as Tan Zi.
King Tan established the Tan Kingdom, which was situated in the current Shandong Province Ji Nan (山东省济南) (Li City) (历城), 70 miles east South of Long Shan Township (龙山镇). That is about 2 miles east/north of the Long Shan Station of the Jiao Ji Railway Line (龙山胶济铁路). It is also name as Dong Ping Ling District (东平陵县) or Ping Ling District (平陵县). It was pronounced as a Royal Kingdom by Han Wen Di (汉文帝) after ruling it for 16 years.
However, the Kingdom was abolished when Tai Zong Zhen Guang from the State of Chü (齊國) defeated the Tan state. The descendants of the Tan family fled, mainly to the provinces of Guangdong and He Nan. The writing of the surname was also changed from 談 to 譚 to avoid pursuit by enemies.
The Tham clan # Today, there are over 1 million members of the Tan clan spread across the world, including Malaysia and Australia. Many Tan people identify as Taishanese (台山) or Sze Yup people (四邑廣東人).

478. T\u0026rsquo;an2 譚 # The surname T\u0026rsquo;an (譚) came from two sources: 1. Yüan ho hsing tsuan traces the origin of the surname T\u0026rsquo;an (譚) as follows: the surname derivd [sic] from the name of the feudal territory, the State of T\u0026rsquo;an (T\u0026rsquo;an kuo 譚國) in the Spring and Autumn (Ch\u0026rsquo;un ch\u0026rsquo;iu 春秋) Period. After the State of T\u0026rsquo;an was defeated by the State of Chü (齊國), its descendants formally adopted T\u0026rsquo;an as their common surname. The family initially settled in Shan-tung (山東) and later prospered in Hu-nan (湖南) provinces. 2. The surname T\u0026rsquo;an (譚) branched from the surname T\u0026rsquo;an (談) due to a change of character for the name to avoid revenge of the family by the rivals.

479. T\u0026rsquo;an2 談 # The surname T\u0026rsquo;an (談) derived from the following two sources: 1. According to Ch\u0026rsquo;ien chia hsing, the eldest son of the Shang (商) king Ti-i (帝乙) whose name was Wei Tzu-ch\u0026rsquo;i (微子) ? was bestowed with the feudal territory of the State of Sung (Sung kuo 宋國) by Chou Wu-wang (周武王). Thirty-six generations later, the State of Sung was ruled by T\u0026rsquo;an Chün (談公) after he defeated the State of Ch\u0026rsquo;u (Ch\u0026rsquo;u kuo 楚國) and T\u0026rsquo;an was adopted as a common surname by his descendants. 2. The surname T\u0026rsquo;an follows the ancestral line of Chi T\u0026rsquo;an (籍談) who was a grand master (ta-fu 大夫) in the Chou (周) dynasty. His descendants initially adopted the surname T\u0026rsquo;an (談) but later changed to T\u0026rsquo;an (譚) after the family escaped from the homeland to avoid revenge by the rivals.

The noodles are usually thin egg noodles and the sauce tends to be thick, dark, slightly sweet. As a child, my mum sometimes buy them from a hawker stall when she goes to the market in the early morning, so by the time we kids get up, we are treated a beautiful kon loh mee as a breakfast!
The best kon loh mee used to be served in a restaurant in Petaling Jaya near the Cold Storage supermarket. Sadly, I don’t believe the restaurant is still there but if anyone knows otherwise please let me know.
My recipe is a simple ones based on a combination of various recipes I have found on the Internet.
Recipe for Malaysian Kon Loh Mee # Equipment # Pot Saucepan Stove Ingredients # Sauce:
1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon oyster sauce (can subsitute with vegetarian oyster sauce) 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (kechap manis) 1 teaspoon Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam) 1 teaspoon sesame oil Other:
125-150 g egg noodles (you can typically buy this fresh from Asian supermarkets, the one I tend to use is called “Ever Green” from a company called “Unigreen” which I buy from Miracle Supermarket) cooking oil (any type will do – I use sunflower oil) 1 stalk broccoli leaves (or similar, I use broccolini for an elevated presentation) 1 pot water (boiling) Instructions # Mix soy, kechap manis, fish sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil in a bowl. Remove outer skin of shallot and cut and slice finely into rings (around 1-2mm thickness). Start heating shallots in a saucepan with a bit of oil (just enough to slightly coat the shallots). Boil water in a pot and poach broccoli leaves or broccolini for a few minutes until soft (usually no more than 2 minutes – I prefer mine slightly al dente). Take out and drain. Cut into 10cm stalks or leave uncut if you want a more rustic look. Put the noodles in the leftover boiling water and continue heating the water until it starts boiling again. Don’t overcook the noodles – generally no longer than 2-3 minutes or even shorter if you like it al dente like me. As noodle boils, the shallots should be browning. Remove browned shallots and put aside in a small dish. Once noodle is boiled, remove and drain and then rinse using cold water. This makes the noodles “springy.” In the saucepan where the shallots have been browned, leave the oil residue on the pan and pour the sauce mix into the pan. The sauce will heat up really quickly and start sizzling. When the sauce is sizzling, pour the rinsed noodles into the saucepan and start mixing until the noodles have warmed up again. Take out the stirred noodles and serve with broccoli leave/broccolini in a place. Add your favourite topping (char siu or BBQ pork, wantan, or whatever). I’ve even tried putting pork floss on top. Put the browned fried shallots on top as a garnish. Examples # Please click on any photo to view full screen.

Although the bike still works, I noticed the steering has become less confident, particularly braking down a descent, so it was probably time for a change. Also, I mainly use it to commute to road, and the race geometry and components make it a fairly harsh ride over the roadworks around the city.
